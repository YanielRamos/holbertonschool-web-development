This is a simple webpage I created as part of an assignment. The webpage is built using **HTML** and demonstrates basic structure, styling, and interaction elements. The project focuses on learning the fundamentals of web development and creating a visually appealing and functional webpage.

## Project Features

- **Styling with CSS**: I styled the webpage with basic CSS to make it visually appealing and organized. I applied concepts like margins, padding, background colors, and flexible layouts.
- **Interactive Elements**: I added buttons and links to make the webpage interactive. This project helped me understand how HTML elements can be linked together and styled.

## What I Learned
